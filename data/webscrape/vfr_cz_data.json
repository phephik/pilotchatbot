The coordination is executed by means of LARS (Local Activity Reservation System) application ,  which is accessible from web environment via a web browser`s interface. Each user has to be registered in the system (by using login name and password) common for the application of Flight information services of the CR.

The application accessibility is also assured via selfbriefing workstation at LKKV.  1.10 . 2  Pilots and aircraft operators Pilots and aircraft operators intending to execute a LFA in CTR \/ TMA Karlovy Vary are obliged to submit their requirement by filling of the form on webpage http:\/\/lis.rlp.cz\/lars together with the basic flight parameters (flight rules ,  type of flight ,  flight identification ,  contact to the pilot ,  requested LFA time period) and with the description of requested LFA. For LFA to be performed ,  it is inevitable to obtain the confirmation in a form of a \u201cLFA slot\u201d ,  containing a time period ,  determined for the execution of the expected flight activity. The LFA slot acquisition is compulsory for all pilots and aircraft operators intending to perform the activities characterized as repetitive: landings and take-offs (touch and go landings) low approaches over the RWY or instrument approaches at the LKKV irrespective of the flight rules and\/or the type of flight. LFA slot represents the time period of LFA execution exclusively. The time of entry to the CTR or TMA Karlovy Vary is considered the time of LFA beginning. The time of LFA termination is considered when the outbound flight is commenced towards the destination aerodrome or the time of landing at LKKV. The reservation is not required for the single movements over the RWY not corresponding to the principle of LFA ,  i.e. e.g.: one aerodrome traffic circuit flight beginning and terminating at the appropriate airport ,  single touch and go at local airport from cross country flights where departure and\/or arrival airport are different from the appropriate aerodrome or single instrument approach terminated with full stop landing or with low approach (pass) continuing to other destination than local airport.

The coordination is executed by means of LARS (Local Activity Reservation System) application ,  which is accessible from web environment via a web browser`s interface. Each user has to be registered in the system (by using login name and password) common for the application of Flight information services of the CR.

For LFA to be performed ,  it is inevitable to obtain the confirmation in a form of a \u201cLFA slot\u201d ,  containing a time period ,  determined for the execution of the expected flight activity. The LFA slot acquisition is compulsory for all pilots and aircraft operators intending to perform the activities characterized as repetitive: landings and take-offs (touch and go landings) low approaches over the RWY or instrument approaches at the LKMT irrespective of the flight rules and\/or the type of flight. LFA slot represents the time period of LFA execution exclusively. The time of entry to the CTR Mo\u0161nov or TMA Ostrava is considered the time of LFA beginning. The time of LFA termination is considered when the outbound flight is commenced towards the destination aerodrome or the time of landing at LKMT.

The coordination is executed by means of LARS (Local Activity Reservation System) application ,  which is accessible from web environment via a web browser`s interface. Each user has to be registered in the system (by using login name and password) common for the application of Flight information services of the CR. Without signing in to the system ,  it is not allowed to create or modify any reservation. The application accessibility is also assured via selfbriefing workstation at LKTB.  1.2 . 2  Pilots and aircraft operators Pilots and aircraft operators intending to execute a LFA in CTR Tu\u0159any are obliged to submit their requirement by filling of the form on webpage http:\/\/lis.rlp.cz\/lars together with the basic flight parameters (flight rules ,  type of flight ,  flight identification ,  contact to the pilot ,  requested LFA time period) and with the description of requested LFA. For LFA to be performed ,  it is inevitable to obtain the confirmation in a form of a \u201cLFA slot\u201d ,  containing a time period ,  determined for the execution of the expected flight activity. The LFA slot acquisition is compulsory for all pilots and aircraft operators intending to perform the activities characterized as repetitive: landings and take-offs (touch and go landings) low approaches over the RWY or instrument approaches at the LKTB irrespective of the flight rules and\/or the type of flight. LFA slot represents the time period of LFA execution exclusively. The time of entry to the CTR Tu\u0159any is considered the time of LFA beginning. The time of LFA termination is considered when the outbound flight is commenced towards the destination aerodrome or the time of landing at LKTB. The reservation is not required for the single movements over the RWY not corresponding to the principle of LFA ,  i.e. e.g.: one aerodrome traffic circuit flight beginning and terminating at the appropriate airport ,  single touch and go at local airport from cross country flights where departure and\/or arrival airport are different from the appropriate aerodrome or single instrument approach terminated with full stop landing or with low approach (pass) continuing to other destination than local airport. Despite received and confirmed \u201cLFA slot\u201d ,  appropriate ATC unit at LKTB has the right to modify or even to cancel confirmed reservation due to operational reasons. Pilot is notified of this fact via email or SMS on the registered phone number.  1.2 . 3  Contingency procedures In case of LARS outage or failure ,  LFA in CTR Tu\u0159any shall be coordinated with ATC unit on frequency of TWR or GND before starting the engines or before entering the area of responsibility of appropriate ATS units.  1.3  Aircraft taxiing and parking  1.3 . 1  Authorized signalmen control the movement and assign parking positions on aprons.  1.3 . 2  Taxi clearance issued by the GROUND unit or TWR does not exempt the pilot from his duty to follow the signalman instructions.

For this reason (if not possible otherwise) ,  after start up of one of the engines with assistance of ASU ,  the aircraft is desired to taxi from the stand to adjacent TWY A ,  turn into the direction of taxiing and to stop on TWY A ,  then with apron controller's assistance to carry out start up of the next engine with increased revolutions of the already started up engine.
